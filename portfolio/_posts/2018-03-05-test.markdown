Rodgers was off to one of the best starts of his career -- with 13 touchdowns and three interceptions plus a 4-1 record -- when he broke his collarbone, so there's no sense that he's close to the beginning of his decline. But the Packers have to protect themselves better than they did last year in case disaster strikes Rodgers again. Hundley will get another shot at the backup job, but the Packers need to make sure they have other options in case Hundley doesn't progress.

The game plan: The short-term concern is the backup position, after Hundley didn't play as well as expected for someone who had been in the system for three years. The Packers decided against signing a veteran quarterback after Rodgers got hurt, but perhaps they should now in case something happens again. The long-term issue is when to start thinking about drafting Rodgers' eventual successor. Rodgers will turn 35 in December; Brett Favre was 35 when the Packers picked Rodgers, but he was also waffling about his future. Rodgers wants to play until at least 40, but at some point new GM Brian Gutekunst will have to find a successor.
